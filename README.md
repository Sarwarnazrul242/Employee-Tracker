# Employee-Tracker

This project involves developing a Java program that allows users to manage employees by performing various functions such as adding, dropping, updating, counting, and displaying employees. The program creates an Employees table if it does not already exist in the database.

The main menu of the program will present users with six options to choose from, including adding an employee, dropping an employee, updating an employee's hiring date, counting the number of employees, displaying all employees, and exiting the program.

The program will ask the user to input relevant employee information such as EID, first name, last name, and date of employment, and then display a message confirming the successful addition of the employee.

The program will also provide options to drop an employee from the database, update an employee's hiring date, count the number of employees, and display all employees in the table.

Overall, this program will provide a simple and efficient way for users to manage employee information in a database.

# What I Learned from this Project:
Developing an Employee Management System using Java and a database requires knowledge and skills in both programming and database management. Through this project, I gained experience in:

- Creating a database table using Java and SQL
- Inserting, deleting, and updating data in a database table using Java
- Writing code to handle user input and output
- Implementing error handling to ensure the program runs smoothly and efficiently
